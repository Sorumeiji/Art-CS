          <h3>Summary: Requesting an avatar with a background of Yasu praying</h3>
          <p>
            In this request, I am wanting my original character, Yasu, in prayer with her hand folded, and head slightly bowed. For the background, I was wanting an aura that surrounded her, I wanted
            the background to be a fantasy / mystical forest like.

                <h2> Offline Background</h2>
                <h3>Summary: Requesting an Offline Screen for my Twitch Channel.</h3>
                <p>In this request, I would want an offline background of Yasu on her knees praying by an old japanese
                    shrine in a fantasy / mystical forest. The forest will have big trees surrounding the shrine, with
                    particles of light, spirits, or souls. Her sword should be on the ground flat next to her while she
                    is praying.</p>

          <p>
            For text I would like it to say “Until we meet again” for the main letters, and in a smaller font Underneath, I would like it to say the same words, but in Japanese. For social display, I
            just need my Twitch and Twitter displayed in the background.
          </p>

          <h2>Fantasy Background</h2>
          <h3>Summary: Requesting a background of Yasu, and her pet Snake ( Dragon that Noa drew ) fighting Oni.</h3>
          <p>
            In this request I would like a background of Yasu, with her snake companion, who is about to engage in battle against a female human like oni. The battle will take place in the same forest
            in front of a temple, the setting will take place at night on a full moon, and starry sky, there is a light fog in the area as well. Yasu’s pose and position looks like she is about to
            prepare for a strike, either in a crouching Iai stance, The oni attacking in the air like a leap attack. Her dragon ( snake ) companion, Kaida, is standing straight up, preparing to bite
            the Oni.
          </p>

          <p>This can be done in your bright color style if you choose to, though this description sounds dark. I really love your soft color style for this.</p>

          <h3>Summary: Requesting a social media banner for Twitch and Twitter.</h3>
          <p>
            Here I would like a Twitch and Twitter social media banner. I really love your past designs for other commissions you have done for others. I would like the banner to have Yasu, in a happy
            head shot of her smiling with her head tilted a bit. For the rest of the design, it can be in a japanese style design that fits with Yasu theme of Eternity, Magic, and Spirit.
